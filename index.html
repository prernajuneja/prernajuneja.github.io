      Hello! <br></br>
      I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Seattle University. Before
joining SU, I obtained my Ph.D. in Information Science from University of Washington.<br></br>
My research focuses on understanding how problematic information appears and is moderated
on online platforms and then designing defenses against the problematic information by
considering human-centered insights from stakeholder groups. <br></br> I'm curently pursuing
research in the Responsible AI space with a focus on investigating algorithms for bias and
designing for trust, agency, transparency, and explainability.
