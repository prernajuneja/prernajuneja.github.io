      <b>longer version:</b> I work at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer security and privacy (S&P) to measure and mitigate digital technologies' role in harm: how platforms, devices, and algorithms are increasingly weaponized to control and harass the most vulnerable among us. I focus on high-stakes and real-world contexts where technology is central to people's experiences of vulnerability, and where power dynamics make it difficult for individuals to overcome the harms they face. My research style involves partnering with affected communities to build and evaluate experimental systems improving their safety and well-being. Through this practice, I develop transferable principles for responsible computing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I publish at top-tier venues in HCI and social computing (ACM CHI, CSCW) and S&P (USENIX Security, IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy). Together with my amazing collaborators, students and mentors, I have earned 3 Best Paper Awards (top 1%), 1 Honorable Mention (top 5%), and third place in the 2020 Internet Defense Prize, as well as fellowships from Microsoft Research, Cornell IS, the Consortium for the Science of Sociotechnical Systems, and Rising Stars in EECS. 
      Our work has additionally been published in JAMA, a top-tier medical journal, and appeared at highly selective privacy conferences, including the Privacy Law Scholars Conference and the Reidenberg Northeast Privacy Scholars Workshop.
