    <h1>Prerna Juneja</h1>
    <p>
      I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Seattle University. Before
      joining SU, I obtained my Ph.D. from the <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/">Information School</a> at the University of Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research focuses on understanding how problematic information appears and is moderated
      on online platforms and then designing defenses against the problematic information by
      considering human-centered insights from stakeholder groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently pursuing research in the Responsible AI space with a focus on investigating algorithms for bias and
      designing for trust, agency, transparency, and explainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since January 2024, I have also been part of OpenAI's Red Teaming Network, participating in efforts to assess the risks and safety profiles of OpenAI's models and systems.
