      I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Seattle University. Before
joining SU, I obtained my Ph.D. in Information Science from University of Washington.
My research focuses on understanding how problematic information appears and is moderated
on online platforms and then designing defenses against the problematic information by
considering human-centered insights from stakeholder groups. I'm interested in pursuing
research in the Responsible AI space with a focus on investigating algorithms for bias and
designing for trust, agency, transparency, and explainability.      </p>
